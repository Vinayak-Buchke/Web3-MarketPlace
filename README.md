# Decentralized OLX
Designed a blockchain-based online marketplace leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable secure and seamless buying and selling of digital products. 

To address scalability challenges inherent in Ethereum mainnet transactions, the system incorporates a 2-layer architecture inspired by Polygon zkEVM, a Layer 2 rollup solution. This approach offloads transaction execution to Layer 2 while anchoring data availability and state transition verification on Ethereum Layer 1—ensuring security, reliability, and reduced congestion on the base layer.

## Prerequisites

1. Any Editor (Preferably VS Code)
2. Any web browser with latest version
3. Node Package manager
4. A Metamask Account and metamask extension

## Languages and Technologies used
1. HTML5/CSS3
2. JavaScript (to create dynamically updating content)
3. React Js
4. Node js
5. IPFS (Decentralized  Database)
6. Solidity for Smart Contract
7. Metamask Wallet
8. ⁠Hardhat (For testing and deploying)
9. Alchemy (For interacting with the Sepolia testnet and ⁠layer 2 zkEVM polygon protocol)
10. ⁠Pinata (Gateway for Decentralized Database)

## Conclusion
Based on the data gathered and the analysing done, we have recorded that after the combined application of all the scalability solutions, the total transaction cost is 75.27% less as compared to traditional Layer-1 deployment. 

Similarly, the total gas fee is recorded 80.27% less after applying the scalability solutions. This study concludes that the scalability issues that current blockchain networks are facing can be resolved by combined application of these technologies. The empirical data indicates a significant drop in gas and overall transaction costs, two important indicators of the functionality and adoption of blockchain markets.
